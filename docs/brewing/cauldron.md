# Cauldron

![](../assets/images/brewing/cauldron.webp){ .item-image }

A [cauldron](../brewing/cauldron.md) is required for brewing all [potions](../brewing/potion.md). After 3 ingredients have been placed inside, it will brew for a few seconds before finishing the potion. On the corner of the base, there is a small button to reset the [cauldron](../brewing/cauldron.md).
