# Brewing Overview

Brewing allows you to create potions with unique effects. By combining ingredients in a [cauldron](../brewing/cauldron.md), you can craft potions that enhance abilities, hinder youself, or provide utility in various situations.

## How Brewing Works
1. **Gather Ingredients**: Collect the required items, such as [Brewshrooms](../brewing/brewshroom.md), flowers, and other ingedients.
2. **Use the Cauldron**: Add three ingredients to the [cauldron](../brewing/cauldron.md). The combination determines the potion created.
3. **Collect the Potion**: Once brewed, use a bottle to collect the potion.

## What Different Ingredients Do

Each potion uses a [brewshroom](../brewing/brewshroom.md) as one of its ingredients. The [normal brewshroom](../brewing/brewshroom.md) provides a shorter potion duration, but if you swap it out with the [tall brewshroom](../brewing/tallBrewshroom.md) you can extend its duration.

Most potions either use the [good flower](../brewing/flowerYellow.md), or the [evil flower](../brewing/flowerYellow.md). Using a [good flower](../brewing/flowerYellow.md) will result in a positive effect, like [healing](../brewing/healing.md). Using a [purple flower](../brewing/flowerPurple.md) will result in a negative effect, like [poison](../brewing/poison.md).

The remaining items will determine the characteristics of the potion. Here is a list of the differnt ingredients, and what effects they provide:
